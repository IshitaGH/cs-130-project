# Welcome to Roomies
Roomies is a mobile app that improves communication between roommates at every step. From chores lists that automatically update to an expense tracker that simplifies settling roommate-related expenses, Roomies aims to streamline the roommate experience, reduce conflicts, and help promote a peaceful and healthy atmosphere.

## Setup
See `frontend/README.md` and `backend/README.md` for help setting up the project locally for development. `frontend/` is the client app built with React Native, and `backend/` stores the backend service built with Docker, Flask, and Postgres. 

## Local Development with Public WiFi
- Use `ngrok` to generate a public URL for your local backend app
  - Copy the public URL into `frontend/config.ts` (see `frontend/README.md` for more details on this)
