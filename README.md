# Welcome to Roomies

## Setup
See frontend/README.md and backend/README.md for help setting up the project locally for development.

## Local Development with Public WiFi
- Use `ngrok` to generate a public URL for your local backend app
  - Copy the public URL into `frontend/config.ts` (see `frontend/README.md` for more details on this)
- Use a tunnel for the Expo app as well
  - e.g. `npx expo start --tunnel`
